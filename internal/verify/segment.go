// VerifySegment validates a contiguous range of an account's blocks.
//
// For each block, the verifier:
//
//  1. Confirms block.Address == segment.Address (consistency) and rejects
//     negative or greater-than-255-bit amounts before hashing.
//  2. Recomputes block.ComputeHash() and compares against
//     block.BlockHash. Mismatch → REJECT/InvalidHash.
//  3. Binds block.PublicKey to block.Address per go-zenon
//     (verifier/account_block.go:399-446):
//     - Embedded-contract addresses (addr[0] == ContractAddrByte):
//     require empty PublicKey AND empty Signature; skip ed25519.
//     - User addresses: require chain.PubKeyToAddress(PublicKey) ==
//     Address, then verify Ed25519 over the recomputed hash.
//  4. For blocks beyond the first, verifies linkage against a
//     locally-verified parent anchor. The anchor advances ONLY after
//     a block's final result is ACCEPT, so a forged BlockHash on a
//     rejected block cannot become an apparent parent for the next
//     block. A block whose previous segment entry did not ACCEPT
//     short-circuits to ReasonParentNotAccepted (REJECT cascades to
//     REJECT, REFUSED cascades to REFUSED — the gap persists). When
//     the parent did ACCEPT, the child must satisfy
//     block[k].PreviousHash == verified_parent_hash and
//     block[k].Height == verified_parent_height + 1.
//  5. Looks up CommitmentEvidence(s) in commitments whose Target ==
//     block.AccountHeader. The bundle may carry multiple candidates
//     (rare; legitimate during a reorg attestation): each is tried,
//     and the block ACCEPTs if any candidate ACCEPTs. None matched →
//     REFUSED/MissingProof.
//  6. Runs VerifyCommitment(state, evidence, policy) on each candidate.
//     The committing momentum must be in the retained window AND
//     finality-deep enough (tip.Height ≥ evidence.Height + policy.W) —
//     enforced by VerifyCommitment via ReasonHeightOutOfWindow and
//     ReasonInsufficientFinality. Note: a block's MomentumAcknowledged
//     is the producer's anchor at block-creation time and does NOT
//     necessarily equal the committing momentum — the committing
//     momentum is whichever momentum's MomentumContent first included
//     this block's AccountHeader, typically MomentumAcknowledged + ~1.
//
// Caveat (per bounded-verification-boundaries.md §G1, NG1, NG2):
// ACCEPT means each block's AccountHeader is committed by the same
// r_C the verified header chain bound, each block is signed by the
// keypair whose SHA3-truncation equals block.Address, and the
// committing momentum has W headers verified past it. It does NOT
// prove the underlying state transitions executed correctly (NG1) or
// that this is the only block at (Address, Height) on the canonical
// chain (NG6).
