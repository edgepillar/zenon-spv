This document records the chosen producer-verification source, the
schedule shape, the verifier semantics, and the residual trust
assumptions. The code path is now:

1. `tools/derive-producer-schedule` derives a JSON schedule from
   multiple peers.
2. `verify.LoadProducerSchedule` validates schedule structure and hash.
3. `zenon-spv verify-* --schedule <path>` and
   `zenon-spv watch --schedule <path>` require each header's
   `(height, timestamp, producing-address)` to match the schedule.
4. A mismatch returns `REJECT/ReasonUnauthorizedProducer`; missing
   coverage returns `REFUSED/ReasonProducerSetUnknown`.

The vault ADR 0004 (`zenon-spv-vault/decisions/0004-producer-set-quorum-check.md`)
originally evaluated five options and deferred all of them. This
design reopens the question and chooses **per-momentum
expected-producer attestation**, the strongest tractable
verification the SPV can perform without re-implementing go-zenon's
election algorithm. Local derivation of the producer sequence from
chain-observed Pillar register/revoke events is deferred to a
future phase.

---

## 1. What go-zenon enforces

The SPV must match go-zenon's own consensus check, not approximate
it. From `reference/go-zenon/consensus/consensus.go:73-95`:

```go
func (cs *consensus) GetMomentumProducer(timestamp time.Time) (*types.Address, error) {
    election, err := cs.electionManager.ElectionByTime(timestamp)
    ...
    for _, plan := range election.Producers {
        if plan.StartTime == timestamp {
            return &plan.Producer, nil
        }
    }
    return nil, errors.Errorf("couldn't find producer for timestamp")
}

func (cs *consensus) VerifyMomentumProducer(momentum *nom.Momentum) (bool, error) {
    expected, err := cs.GetMomentumProducer(*momentum.Timestamp)
    if err != nil {
        return false, err
    }
    if momentum.Producer() == *expected {
        return true, nil
    }
    return false, nil
}
```

And from `reference/go-zenon/chain/nom/momentum.go:84-90`:

```go
func (m *Momentum) Producer() types.Address {
    if m.producer == nil {
        producer := types.PubKeyToAddress(m.PublicKey)
        m.producer = &producer
    }
    return *m.producer
}
```

Two consequences for the SPV:

1. **Authorization is per slot, not per set.** Election is bucketed
   into `tick`s; each tick has a `Producers []ProducerEvent` list
   where each entry pins `StartTime` to exactly one producer
   address. The expected producer at `timestamp` is the unique
   producer whose `StartTime == timestamp`. Active-set membership
   is insufficient: a Pillar active at height H but not elected
   for that specific slot is NOT authorized for that slot.

2. **The producer address derives from the momentum's `PublicKey`
   via `types.PubKeyToAddress`.** The SPV already implements this
   path as `chain.PubKeyToAddress` for the F1 segment-block
   binding; the producer authorizer reuses it.

The election algorithm itself uses a `proofBlock` (the momentum
before `genProofTime(tick)`) to seed the per-tick producer order,
running against Pillar delegations stored at that block. The SPV
cannot replay this without shadowing a non-trivial slice of Zenon
consensus state.

---

## 2. Source of per-momentum producers

**Choice: an operator-attested `(height → expected_producer)`
schedule covering explicit height ranges, produced by walking each
momentum in the range on N independent fully-synced nodes.**

### Why this and not local derivation

Local derivation of the producer sequence is the long-term answer.
It requires:

- Decoding Pillar register/revoke events from embedded-contract
  account blocks.
- Reconstructing Pillar delegation state at every election's
  `proofBlock`.
- Running go-zenon's election algorithm against that state.
- Tracking spork-mediated rule changes.

That is multi-week scope and a separate phase. The current
implementation ships the per-momentum table to close the immediate
gap; local derivation remains a follow-up that can drop the table once
shipped.

### How the table is derived

`tools/derive-producer-schedule` iterates a declared height range
against operator-selected peers via JSON-RPC. It requires at least two
distinct endpoint strings, and a quorum between two and the peer count.
By default every configured peer must agree; three or more independently
operated peers are recommended. Repeated endpoint strings are refused,
but different URLs can still resolve to the same node or operator.

The requested range must start at height 2 or later and contain at most
1,000,000 entries. Genesis has no elected signer. Range and quorum checks
run before network access or entry allocation. Batching handles a terminal
`uint64` height without wrapping; the batch size is clipped to the remaining
range. For each height H:

1. Fetch the momentum at H from every peer (already supported via
   `internal/fetch.MultiClient`).
2. Require the expected height and configured chain ID, a supported layout,
   a matching recomputed hash, and a valid Ed25519 signature. Require links
   between successive observed headers, including across batch boundaries.
3. Record `(H → (momentum.TimestampUnix, chain.PubKeyToAddress(momentum.PublicKey)))`.
4. At least the configured quorum must return usable responses, and all
   usable responses must agree on the hash, public key, and signature.
   Any disagreement aborts
   derivation — the tool refuses to emit a schedule, the operator
   must investigate, and no caveat downgrade follows. Recording the
   timestamp is load-bearing: go-zenon's
   `GetMomentumProducer(timestamp)` resolves the expected producer
   via the timestamp, not the height, so the SPV must verify both
   to avoid admitting a timestamp-mutation attack.

Each peer's startup frontier must be at or above the requested range,
belong to the configured chain, and pass hash/signature checks. If it is
exactly at the last requested height, it must match the later range read,
including its signer and signature. Higher frontier observations are not
linked back to the range because the intervening headers are not fetched.

The tool produces a JSON file only after all observations pass, so a
derivation failure preserves any existing output. Destination checks precede
RPC: the parent must exist, and an existing destination must be a regular file,
not a symlink or special file. Publication writes a same-directory temporary
file, checks a complete write, syncs and closes it, rechecks the destination,
then replaces the destination and syncs its directory on non-Windows systems.
Staging failures preserve existing bytes and file identity; replacing a hard
link does not modify its other names. A failure after replacement reports that
new bytes are visible with durability unconfirmed. Windows directory durability
remains best-effort. This does not coordinate concurrent exporters; use a trusted
output directory and one writer per destination.

New and replaced schedules use private `0600` permissions where the filesystem
supports Unix modes. CLI progress, completion, and runtime errors after argument
parsing omit output paths and configured endpoint values; help defaults also
omit environment endpoints. Output errors retain their
underlying causes for programmatic inspection. The file itself contains the
per-height table plus metadata (§3). Metadata records the actual configured
endpoints and their observed frontier heights, not per-header endorsements.
Each schedule explicitly declares which height range
its derivation covered; there is **no** automatic extrapolation
before the first observed height or after the last. Coverage of
non-contiguous ranges is supported (two separate `ProducerCoverage`
entries) but each range must independently come from observations.

These checks establish internal consistency of observations under the chosen
peer assumptions. The tool does not authenticate the first previous hash,
remote identity, activation rules, elected producers, or canonical history.
It can record signed v1/v2 observations without an activation profile;
the verifier separately requires a profile when consuming v2 headers.
A fully consistent fabricated chain can still produce a schedule. Protect
and independently justify the schedule before using it as a trust input.

### Size and shipping

A checkpoint-interval range (~1M momentums) produces ~36MB of
table data (1M × 36 bytes for `(uint64 Height, uint64 TimestampUnix,
20-byte Address)` packed), before JSON expansion and metadata. The
current implementation ships the schedule as a JSON sidecar loaded via
`--schedule <path>` at the CLI. The embedded-default route remains available
for short ranges if a future use case warrants it; the default
ship-mode for mainnet is sidecar.

A compact wire form (packed binary, possibly delta-encoded over
the address byte stream) is a Branch 5b implementation choice; the
table contents are the load-bearing decision and JSON is the
reference shape.

The loader caps a sidecar at 256 MiB, with at most 1,000,000 entries
and 1,000,000 coverage ranges. These hard limits retain room for the
million-momentum design; they are not typical memory-use estimates.
Split longer observations into separate, explicitly selected schedules.
The file-size check and bounded read precede JSON decoding. Array decoding
stops at the count limit; malformed or empty authority rows fail earlier.
Count checks also precede index allocation
and owned-state schedule copies. Validation walks
sorted coverage and entries together in linear time, including terminal
`uint64` heights; it does not iterate over a large claimed gap or rescan
all coverage ranges for each entry.

Schedule JSON requires `chain_id`, `coverage`, `entries`, and `schedule_hash`
exactly once and non-null. Every coverage row requires `from_height` and
`through_height`; every producer row requires `height`, `timestamp_unix`,
and `producing_addr`, under the same rules. Field names must match the
documented spelling and case. Unknown fields, case aliases, and duplicate
fields (including escaped spellings of the same name) are rejected before
validation can create an authorization index. Explicit zero scalar values
remain available for custom schedules; missing values are never inferred.
This intentionally rejects files that previously depended on JSON field
overwriting or omitted authority fields.

The audit metadata fields `generated_at`, `source_peers`, and `source_heights`
remain optional and may be null, but cannot repeat at the top level. Metadata
does not contribute to the schedule hash or authenticate producer elections.
Parsing a schedule alone does not authorize it: `Validate` must still check
coverage, dense entries, and the content hash. A failed parse leaves any
existing in-memory schedule unchanged. CLI schedule failures precede state
loading, writer locking, and watch RPC requests; JSON diagnostics exclude
private filenames, arbitrary field names, and metadata values.

## 3. Schedule wire shape

```go
// In a new internal/verify/producers.go (Branch 5b):

// ProducerCoverage declares a contiguous height range that the
// schedule attests producer values for. Required ⇔ the verifier
// will only consult schedule entries inside a declared range.
type ProducerCoverage struct {
    FromHeight    uint64  // inclusive
    ThroughHeight uint64  // inclusive
}

// ProducerEntry is one (height, expected-timestamp, expected-producer-address)
// triple. Sorted by Height; contiguous within each ProducerCoverage range.
// The timestamp is included because go-zenon resolves the expected producer
// via timestamp (consensus.go GetMomentumProducer); a height-only entry
// would admit a timestamp-mutation attack (Codex review v2 P1).
type ProducerEntry struct {
    Height        uint64
    TimestampUnix uint64
    ProducingAddr chain.Address
}

type ProducerSchedule struct {
    ChainID       uint64
    Coverage      []ProducerCoverage // sorted, non-overlapping
    Entries       []ProducerEntry    // sorted, contiguous per coverage range
    GeneratedAt   int64              // Unix seconds at derivation time
    SourcePeers   []string           // peer URLs queried
    SourceHeights map[string]uint64  // per peer, the frontier observed at derivation time
    ScheduleHash  chain.Hash         // SHA3-256 over canonical encoding of ChainID+Coverage+Entries
}
```

Notes:

- **Coverage is explicit.** A height outside any `ProducerCoverage`
  range is `unknown`, never inferred. This closes Codex P1b.
- **Entries are contiguous within each range.** No interpolation
  between recorded heights; every height in a coverage range has
  its own entry.
- **`ScheduleHash` covers the substantive content** (chain ID,
  coverage list, entry list). Tampering with any entry
  invalidates the recompute and the verifier rejects the schedule
  at load time.
- **Metadata is non-load-bearing.** `GeneratedAt`, `SourcePeers`,
  `SourceHeights` are operator audit trail; they're not part of
  the hash because two operators deriving the same range from
  the same peers would otherwise produce different hashes.

The JSON form mirrors the Go struct. The loader accepts exactly one object
with known fields only; unknown fields and trailing data are errors.
Validation rejects unsorted entries, gaps, entries outside coverage,
overlapping ranges, and a recomputed `ScheduleHash` mismatch. Failed
revalidation clears any previous lookup index. As before, callers must keep
a successfully validated schedule read-only; the owned state API captures
its own copy. These integrity checks do not authenticate the operator or
the metadata, and a content hash is not an attestation signature.

---

## 4. Verifier semantics

The verifier's producer-authorization decision is **tri-state**:

| Decision     | Outcome  | Reason                          |
|--------------|----------|---------------------------------|
| Authorized   | continue | —                               |
| Unauthorized | REJECT   | `ReasonUnauthorizedProducer`    |
| Unknown      | REFUSED  | `ReasonProducerSetUnknown`      |

The lookup is exact-match on BOTH height and timestamp:

```
expected := schedule.LookupEntry(header.Height)
if header.Height is not present in any ProducerCoverage:
    return ProducerSetUnknown
if header.TimestampUnix != expected.TimestampUnix:
    // The header claims a different slot time than the schedule
    // attests for this height — this is the timestamp-mutation
    // attack: an elected producer signing inside their height
    // but at a timestamp not equal to their slot's StartTime.
    // go-zenon's GetMomentumProducer(timestamp) would reject; so
    // must the SPV.
    return Unauthorized
if chain.PubKeyToAddress(header.PublicKey) == expected.ProducingAddr:
    return Authorized
return Unauthorized
```

The check is exposed through a new `ProducerAuthorizer` interface,
attached to a new `VerifyOptions` struct (separate from `Policy`,
which stays for resource and finality knobs):

```go
type ProducerDecision int

const (
    ProducerAuthorized ProducerDecision = iota
    ProducerUnauthorized
    ProducerSetUnknown
)

type ProducerAuthorizer interface {
    // Authorize takes (height, timestamp, pubkey). The timestamp
    // is non-optional: a height-only check would admit the
    // timestamp-mutation attack (Codex review v2 P1).
    Authorize(height uint64, timestampUnix uint64, pubkey []byte) ProducerDecision
    Source() ProducerSource // for caveat tier selection
}

type ProducerSource int

const (
    ProducerSourceNone ProducerSource = iota
    ProducerSourceOperatorAttested            // this design
    ProducerSourceLocallyDerivedFromChain     // future phase
)

type ProducerAuthMode int

const (
    ProducerAuthDisabled ProducerAuthMode = iota
    ProducerAuthRequired
)

type ProducerAuthOptions struct {
    Mode       ProducerAuthMode
    Authorizer ProducerAuthorizer
}

type VerifyOptions struct {
    Policy       Policy
    ProducerAuth ProducerAuthOptions
}
```

Required-mode semantics:

- `Mode == ProducerAuthRequired` + `Authorizer == nil` →
  `REFUSED / ReasonProducerSetUnknown` for every header. The
  verifier must not silently downgrade.
- `Mode == ProducerAuthDisabled` → producer check skipped; the
  CLI continues to print Branch-4 tier-1 caveat.
- Any unsupported mode or authorizer decision returns
  `REFUSED / ReasonProducerSetUnknown` without proven guarantees.
  Both incoming-header and retained-window authorization apply this rule.
  Header verification preserves the original state on refusal, including
  when an invalid decision arrives after earlier headers were authorized.

The existing `VerifyHeaders(headers, state, policy)` remains a
thin wrapper that calls
`VerifyHeadersWithOptions(headers, state, VerifyOptions{Policy:
policy, ProducerAuth: ProducerAuthOptions{Mode:
ProducerAuthDisabled}})`. **This is the only compatibility mode
for `VerifyHeaders`.** No embedded-default-Required behavior;
existing tests do not need to change, and production CLI paths
opt in to Required explicitly. (Resolves Codex P2 — v1 left the
compat mode ambiguous.)

---

## 5. Caveat tier under operator-attested per-momentum schedule

When `Source() == ProducerSourceOperatorAttested` and the verifier
runs in `ProducerAuthRequired` mode with a non-nil authorizer, the
CLI ACCEPT caveat shifts from Branch 4's tier 1 to **tier 2**:

```
CAVEAT: producer authorization is checked against an operator-
attested per-momentum schedule derived from N peer RPC snapshots,
not from locally-derived consensus state. ACCEPT is not canonical-
chain proof.
```

Residual trust assumptions under tier 2:

1. **Peer collusion against the snapshot.** N coordinated peers
   serving the same wrong chain produce a self-consistent schedule
   that an offline verifier cannot detect from snapshot data alone.
   `tools/verify-mainnet-genesis` against independent operators
   narrows but does not close this.
2. **Release-binary provenance.** The schedule travels with — or
   alongside — the build; trusting the schedule path requires
   trusting the operator who shipped it. Future signing of the
   schedule by an offline maintainer key tightens this.
3. **Coverage gaps.** Headers outside any declared coverage range
   return REFUSED rather than ACCEPT; not silently inferred.

These all dissolve under tier 3 (locally-derived from chain
data) — a future phase. The NG-class structural caveats (finality,
canonical chain, censorship, cross-verifier agreement, state
transitions) remain regardless of tier.

---

## 6. Mainnet operations

### Initial schedule

For an initial schedule, operators run `tools/derive-producer-schedule`
against three independent mainnet peers. A release schedule should cover
the height range matching the embedded checkpoint list, derived by
walking every momentum in that range.

Derivation cost: ~1M momentums × ~3 peers × one RPC each ≈ 3M
RPC calls. At a conservative 100 calls/s the run takes ~8 hours
per peer. Run once per release; intermediate progress is
checkpointable so a stalled run can resume.

### Update cadence

A new schedule must be derived and shipped any time the verifier
needs to cover headers past the last entry's height. In practice
the release cadence governs this. Operators running the watch loop
against tip will see `REFUSED / ReasonProducerSetUnknown` once
they pass the schedule's `ThroughHeight`, at which point the
release process updates the schedule.

No automatic backdating before the schedule's `FromHeight`. A
verifier asked about earlier heights returns REFUSED rather than
guessing — operators must update the schedule with the additional
coverage.

### Failure modes

- **Peer disagreement during derivation** → tool aborts, no
  schedule shipped, operator investigates.
- **Schedule load fails ScheduleHash recompute** → verifier
  refuses to start in `Required` mode; surfaces the error to the
  operator.
- **Header height outside coverage** → REFUSED, not silently
  ACCEPTed.

---

## 7. Non-goals

To prevent scope creep in Branch 5b:

1. **Do not claim canonical-chain determination.** Per-momentum
   authorization narrows the trust gap; it does not close NG6.
2. **Do not claim multi-peer RPC agreement is consensus quorum
   proof.** The `MultiClient` detects peer disagreement; it does
   not prove what consensus actually agreed to.
3. **Do not silently skip producer authorization in production CLI
   paths.** Defaults must require the check; tests may explicitly
   disable it via `ProducerAuthDisabled`.
4. **Do not introduce embedded-contract state shadowing or
   election-algorithm replay in Branch 5b.** That is the
   tier-3 future phase.
5. **Do not change `Policy` shape.** Producer auth lives on
   `VerifyOptions.ProducerAuth`, separate from `Policy`'s resource
   and finality knobs.
6. **Do not extrapolate coverage.** A height outside any declared
   range is `unknown`, never silently inferred from neighboring
   entries. (Codex P1b lock-in.)

---

## 8. Test coverage required for Branch 5b

The implementation branch must include the following tests:

- Authorized producer at covered height → ACCEPT (tier-2 caveat).
- Unauthorized producer at covered height (i.e., header's pubkey
  derives to a different address than the schedule's entry for
  that height) → REJECT / `ReasonUnauthorizedProducer`.
- Height outside any coverage range → REFUSED /
  `ReasonProducerSetUnknown`.
- `ProducerAuthRequired` with nil authorizer → REFUSED /
  `ReasonProducerSetUnknown` for every input header (no silent
  skip).
- `ProducerAuthDisabled` preserves Branch-4 tier-1 behavior;
  `VerifyHeaders` wrapper continues to work unchanged.
- Schedule load rejects tampered entries (mutating any entry
  invalidates the ScheduleHash recompute).
- Schedule load rejects non-contiguous entries within a declared
  coverage range.
- Tooling: schedule derivation across 3 mock peers with consistent
  responses succeeds; one disagreeing peer at any height aborts
  derivation.
- A previously-active Pillar key signing a header for a slot it
  was not elected for → REJECT / `ReasonUnauthorizedProducer`.
  (Codex review v1 P1a regression coverage.)
- A header at a covered height with the schedule-expected
  producing address but a mutated `TimestampUnix` (different from
  `schedule[height].TimestampUnix`) → REJECT /
  `ReasonUnauthorizedProducer`. (Codex review v2 P1 regression
  coverage — proves the SPV matches go-zenon's
  `GetMomentumProducer(timestamp)` semantics.)

---

## 9. Open implementation decisions (not blocking the design gate)

These are choices Branch 5b can make at implementation time
without further design review:

1. **Schedule binary format.** JSON is the canonical reference;
   a packed binary form for the 24MB-scale shipping case is a
   build-time optimization decision.
2. **Pagination/checkpointing in the derivation tool.** The
   shape (~8h runs, resume-from-height) is set; the on-disk
   intermediate format is a tooling detail.
3. **Sidecar location convention.** Whether the default search
   path is `~/.zenon-spv/schedule.json`, a flag-only model, or
   embed-for-test/sidecar-for-prod. The current recommendation is
   flag-only with no default search path, to force an explicit
   operator choice.

`VerifyHeaders` compat mode is locked to `ProducerAuthDisabled` and
is no longer an open question (Codex P2 resolved in §4).

---

## 10. Follow-up after Branch 5b

- **Tier 3 (locally derived):** observe Pillar register/revoke
  events from committed embedded-contract account blocks; replay
  the election algorithm; drop the per-momentum schedule. Closes
  the schedule-source caveat entirely.
- **Schedule signing:** if release-binary provenance becomes
  insufficient, sign the schedule JSON with an offline maintainer
  key and verify on load.
- **Conformance update:** the §10 "producer-set check" entry in
  `docs/conformance.md` was flipped when Branch 5b landed; the
  trust-model doc's tier-2 caveat matches the CLI output. Future
  doc work follows any further trust-tier changes.
- **Vault ADR 0005:** write a new ADR superseding 0004 once
  operating experience confirms the Branch 5b defaults
  (attestation threshold, sidecar load path, schedule wire
  format). The vault update is the maintainer's responsibility;
  from this repo the vault is treated as read-only.
